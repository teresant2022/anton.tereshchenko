# Junior QA portfolio

## Summary

Hello! My name is ``Anton``, I am a Junior QA specialist! 
Here I'd like to share my cases, pet and training projects with you.

## About me
I graduated from Omsk State University in 2016, Foreign languages department. 
Since 2018 I've been working at international projects in linguistic and safety positions. 
Now I am changing the course once again and look for career opportunity as ``QA specialist``. 

Currently I work at Elefanto Digital Studio and work on my hands-on experience.
We work on various projects and all of them got some bugs to share.
I am binded by NDA, but some things are legit for sharing ;)

## My pros

I am good at searching for mistakes, errors, inconsistencies, always keen on imporoving on-going processes.
