Since my job results are in Russian and I never actually needed to highlight them in English, I believe it is fair to make a brief in English.

What happened:
In course of testing my first commercial app I was having a routine mobile testing - I decided to check what would happen if I rotate the screen while watching video.
The result was quite surprising - the composition of the whole app went horizontal, and not only the current page, but the main page as well.

Fixing this bug took almost 3 weeks for Flutter-developer, but I am happy that I was the one who noticed it first.

There you will find an extract from Jira and a video attachment.
