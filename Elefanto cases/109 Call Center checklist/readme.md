## Brief

The project I currently work on is 109 United Call Center.

It's an emergency call center for citizens.

The thing that I can show is a functional testing checklist for First Line Operator.

### What are the main functions:
- Receive the calls from users.
- Fill the emergency cards and pass them to the Second Line operators.
- Redirect the off-targeted calls (like wrong number dialing, prank calls etc.)

### Aside from the main functions, I included in checklist:
- Authorization checks
- Design and composition checks (whether the page looks in accordance with the approved design)
- Negative checks (e.g. answer the call with AFK or logout status)
- Interface with other modules (e.g. if the off-targeted calls are properly marked and shown in relevant folders)
- All that accompanied by Backend checks (via Swagger/Postman pair)
- Interface with Superuser (e.g. password change).

The project is still on-going and I hope I will be able to share more insights as it goes.
