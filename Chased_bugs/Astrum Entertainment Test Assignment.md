Recently I did a test assignment for Astrum Entertainment and I decided to share it for 3 reasons:

#### 1. I love video games. Period.
#### 2. The test assignment was challenging and still enjoyful - good example.
#### 3. It tested the ability to recognize the bugs in both Functional and Localization aspects - good thing to show.

It took 2 days for me to finish the test assignment, but I enjoyed the process a lot and will to share.

Link to the folder with the results of test assignment. The files are way too big for the repositorium.
